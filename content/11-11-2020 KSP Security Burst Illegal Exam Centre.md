The Rector, Dr. Usman Ogbo's quest towards total transformation of Kogi State Polytechnic, Lokoja receives a boast as illegal Exam Miracle Centres were discovered and raided. A syndicate has created ‘Miracle Centers’ outside campus where students write and pass their exams without invigilation for a fee. Worse still, the deviants threaten the live of whoever hampers their operations.
When interviewed, some students noted that the practice is the norm and that some students connive with compromised staff of the Institution to buy question papers with their exams written outside the school without invigilators. These question papers are further sent to the general scripts to be marked. Hence, some noted that it is a strong network that involves the staff of the School.
However, no fewer than 44 suspects are already in the net on the issue. These were disclosed to newsmen on Monday by a rattled Dr. Salihu Ogbo Usman, Rector of the institution. He said two of the centers were bursted recently at Seriki Noma, a community with predominant student population which shares boarder with the Polytechnic.
The outlaws who created and run the centres have their own pervert processes. Listen to a threatened Dr. Ogbo: “On the 5th of November 2020 , our team of security were able to burst one of the centres called ” Champion Logde” at Sarkin Noma a suburb of Lokoja after the primary school. “Even as the suspects escaped before the arrival of the security team, a total of 32 scripts already answered with respect to different courses bearing students particulars respectively written were retrieved from “California Lodge” at the same Sarki Noma where they were kept for onward transmission to their principals” He said that further efforts has led to the arrest of the participants at the magic centre on Friday last week ,who confessed to not only participated, but also paid N2,000 per paper.
As at Monday, the Rector said additional 12 participants of the alleged magic centres were also arrested and they equally confessed to the involvement in the malpractice, while two students of the school ,Victor Attah the owner of the room used as the magic centre and Daniel Ikoja whose room was used as transit point of the scripts were arrested.
Meanwhile, the Rector has cried out over alleged threat to his life and that of his mother. He said some persons were after their lives for his efforts to reform the institution. The Rector, however states that he remain resolute and committed towards the task of changing the face of the institution.
