On April 7, 2020 at the thick of the Covid-19 pandemic lockdown in Nigeria, the news media and social media platforms went agog with the news of the appointment of Dr. Usman Ogbo as the Acting Rector, Kogi State Polytechnic; Lokoja. The appointment however, was not without polarized opinions. To the naysayers, Dr. Usman Ogbo is a sadist and political opportunist whose appointment was a mere political reward and a way to compensate a bloc of political zone within the State without basic administrative competence to manage the exalted academic position. On the other hand, the pro Ogbo faction saw the appointment as a testament for passion and dedication to duties and therefore well-deserved for an academia of repute with track records of academic, managerial and administrative successes especially in the university community. In less than a year in office, Dr. Usman Ogbo has disappointed the naysayers with mind-blowing and unprecedented physical infrastructural development made possible by strategic networking and collaboration necessary for 21st Century leadership coupled with harmonizing differing groups within the Polytechnic framework.

My first personal encounter with Dr. Usman Ogbo was on 21st July, 2020 at a public function where he was the Special Guest of Honor at the Kogi State Polytechnic School of General Studies Annual School Seminar where I was a paper presenter. Dr. Usman Ogbo waste no time in examining and recognizing the enormous challenges within the institution as someone who had been within the system, and hence, provided a tailor – made blueprint to surmounting the challenges identified. He clearly recognized the danger of dissatisfied staff and personnel which he famously refer to Kogi State Polytechnic, Lokoja as “mini Kogi State” with differing groups. Dr. Usman Ogbo from the onset; has made many efforts to harmonize these groups and also the contribution of creative vibes by leading figures within the Polytechnic for remarkable result and productivity. The immediate resultant impact is the coordinated effort of administrative supports and selfless financial contributions of staff towards building a befitting edifice for the Security Unit with modern security apparatuses that can compete favorably with any academic institution in Nigeria.

It is an open secret that before the appointment of Dr. Usman Ogbo, Kogi State Polytechnic; Lokoja was seen as a glorified secondary school and derided thereby becoming a laughing stock in the league of higher institutions within and outside the state due to the gross infrastructural deficit. The first point of attention was the renovation of the school perimeter fencing; having recognized the importance of perception and impression which school environment can have on people. The perimeter fencing was therefore given a facelift with decoration befitting of Polytechnic status. On noticing the dire state of the important units within the Polytechnic, like the Security Unit and the School Clinic, the leadership of Dr. Usman Ogbo swung into action by building a Security Unit “Yahaya Bello Security House” which is a giant step away from the three cubicle stands inherited. This was followed with the conversion of the old library into a modern school clinic “Madam Ohutu Bello Clinic” to serve the school community; which also is a mile away from the 3 bed-space hitherto associated with the Polytechnic before the arrival of Dr. Usman Ogbo. The visible achievements of the Acting Rector which is in line with the New Direction Agenda of the Kogi State Government led State Governor, Alh. Yahaya Bello; the Governor had in his speech expressed that Dr. Usman Ogbo “was given lemon and has so far made lemonade out of it”. The expression show how impressed the governor was with the modest work in such a record period of time and within the limit of the resources available.

The networking and negotiation competence and skills of Dr. Usman Ogbo were brought to bear and harnessed to the fullest with the attraction of TETFUND project and presence to the school premises. It would be recalled that little TETFUND presence had been seen in the Polytechnic before the appointment of Dr. Usman Ogbo as the Acting Rector. This uncommon effort culminated into the present construction of massive edifices (4 building projects ongoing) needed for proper administrative and academic activities. The commendable reasoning of the Acting Rector was the movement of the school football field to a new location to give room for new structures at the entrance of the school. This strategic move was based on the idea that the entrance of the school is the first attraction and positive impression must be created with beautiful scenery in form of structures which are currently ongoing. These projects are undergoing construction and are into advanced stages coupled with massive renovation of existing structures that had been in sorry state for a long time; chief amongst these are the LTA and LTB lecture halls and also the re-vitalization of the long abandoned hostel accommodation with the hope of returning to full operation very soon.

The competence and success story of Dr. Usman Ogbo leadership is not limited to infrastructural development. In the area of administrative and management, the “Midas’s Touch” of the game changer has been visible in every sphere. For a long time, the conduct of examination and subsequent release of results in the school have been with reported abnormalities and irregularities. The first examination conducted under the leadership of the enigmatic Rector showed new intention and ability to stem the tide of academic misconduct and irregularities. The high point of the success was the clampdown on illegal examination center at Sarki Noma axis of Lokoja metropolis through coordinated intelligence gathering where students write exams in collaboration with some staff of the institution for outrageous and undeserved results outside the preview of the school administration.

In an effort to ensure examination malpractice free exams, the recent Post UTME saw the school conducting it first Computer Based Test (CBT) for prospective students. The Computer Based Test (CBT) returned the Polytechnic to the best practice around the world in the conduct of examination and test for applicants. This was made largely possible with the concerted effort towards the restoration of internet connection in the school premises. Another area which has received massive attention is the human capital; In the area of human capital development staff were made to undergo computer training and seminar to further brush the skills of these staff on new trends in Information Communication Technology (ICT). Also, deployment and redeployment of personnel according to established protocol have been made possible all in the bid to ensure effective and efficient service delivery. The management and administration of the Polytechnic has been boosted with the timely set-up of committees headed by staffs with track records of achievements. Notable amongst these is the Alumna Unit to keep in touch with graduates of the institution for opportunities that abound for the growth and development of the school.

Dr. Usman Ogbo is certainly a man of many parts, however, whether for or against, one thing is sacrosanct, Dr. Usman Ogbo is an achiever per excellent and has justified the faith repose in him by the State Governor, Yahaya Bello. Dr. Usman Ogbo appointment as Acting Rector of Kogi State Polytechnic, Lokoja was putting square peg in square hole and quite deserving. Dr. Usman Ogbo has written his name in gold and can compete favorably as one of the best if not the best in the leadership of the Polytechnic. He has so far changed the fortune of the Polytechnic and can be described as the man with the “Midas Touch”. Certainly, Dr. Usman Ogbo is working, Kogi State Polytechnic is progressing!
