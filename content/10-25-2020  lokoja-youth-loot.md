As discovery of covid-19 pallative warehouses trend continues across the country, it took a different dimension in Lokoja, Kogi State on sunday 25th october, 2020. A tension soaked atmosphere was experienced in Felele-Lokoja as rampaging youth embark on a looting spree at the Agricultural Development Project office, Lokoja carting away items such as fertilizers, chemicals, fans, office chairs/tables, computers, spraying machines, pumping machines, photocopier, printers, whelbarrow etc.

At around 5pm youth started trooping in from the NATACO axis based on the report or hint that the remaining pallatives distributed earlier to the people at Kabawa street, Lokoja metropolis is stockedpiled at the ADP office in Felele, Lokoja. On getting to the office /location with the expectation of getting the remaining Kogi State covid-19 pallatives, the youth were metbwith dissapointment. Hence, whatever was in sight became their pallatives as looting of Government properties was at it highest and odd level.

when interviewed some of the youth expressed their bottled up anger towards the government on what they described as the <blockquote>wickedness and insensitivity </blockquote> of the Government for hoarding the palliatives at height and peak of covid-19 pandemic when it was needed most. The youth questioned the justification and rationalization of hoarding and stockpilling pallatives while citizens especially the vulnerable were dying of hunger and starvation during the lockdown.

the looting spree was however brought to a halt at 8pm as security operatives deployed started shooting indiscriminately to disparse the looters in multitudes bringing the rendezrou to an end. In the process a young man was hit at the arm by a stray bullet around st. Peter Primary School, Felele and was rushed to the hospital for treatment. It was a show of shame but a message to the Government on the displeasure of the citizens on maladministration and bad Governance.
