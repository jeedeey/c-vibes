Kogi State Government Refutes Strange Death Claim
Following the alleged death of 50 persons from an unknown pandemic in Olamaboro Local Government Council, the Kogi State Commissioner of Health, Dr. Saka Audu has refuted the reports that a strange disease killed 50 persons in the State. Appearing on Channels TV Sunrise Daily, the Commissioner clarifies that the strange deaths were recorded in neighbouring Enugu State.
It would be recalled that Ujah Ajewo, the Lawmaker representing Olamaboro Local Government had raised a motion of urgent public importance at the flour of the State House of Assembly on Tuesday, 17th November, 2020 saying 50 persons in his constitients at Etteh, a community in Olamaboro Local Government Council have died as a result of the unknown ravaging disease.
In a bid to douse the tension raised by the claims, the Commissioner of Health, Kogi State, Dr. Saka Audu refuted and faulted the lawmaker's claims while urging journalists to visit Etteh community for an on - the - spot assessment and validation of the government position and stance. The Commissioner of Health therefore states that "there is no death from any strange disease on our side of the divide". Etteh, a border community with Enugu State is in Olamaboro Local Government of Kogi State.The Commissioner states that " I have been in contact with Enugu State Commissioner of Health who said samples have been taken (from Enugu Residents), while even NCDC had said the deaths (in Enugu) are from Yellow Fever. "Also, a Rapid Response Team has been sent to Etteh twice and no death was recorded.
Dr. Audu Saka further reveals that the past efforts of the State Government on vaccination has made it nearly impossible for cross - border infections. According to the health commissioner, " Recall that in 2017 we had Yellow Fever outbreak I'm Yagba West, in Kogi State". Part of the State's response was the appropriate vaccination in the local government area and those contiguous ones such as Lokoja, Yagba East and the adjoining local government areas in Kwara State". Also in 2018, there was vaccination for everyone in Kogi State aged 9 months and above, so such deaths as reported is not possible"
