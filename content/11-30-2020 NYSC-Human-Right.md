The National Youth Service Corps is a sheme introduced by the Federal Government(then military government) in the aftermath of the civil war which broke out as an unavoidable consequence of the pogrom in the late 60's, the fatal war and the circumstances leading to it, is an inexhaustible issue altogether.

How ever, it is not uncommon to hear people, particularly youths who are serving under the scheme to whisper about violation of their constitutional rights, according to them, the drills and physical activities in camp is an infringement of their cnstitutional rights to freedom from torture, inhuman and degrading treatment and the rights the against all forms of compulsory and forced labour as enshrined is section 34 of the CFRN.

<blockquote>On the contrary, there are limitations to the constitutionally guaranteed rights, the right against forced and compulsory labour guaranteed by section 34 subsection 2 paragraph e, which is to the effect that "forced or compulsory labour" shall not include any labour or service that forms part of such compulsory national service that forms part of the educational and training of citizens of Nigeria as may be prescribed by an Act of the National assembly.</blockquote>

The NYSC is a creation of an act of the NAtional assembly, and the constitution clearly validates an Act of the National assembly which provides for such labour, required for the educational and training of Nigeria Citizens.

On the above premise, the exercise, drills, parades and other physical activities in camp is by no means a case of human rights violation, it is validated by the grundnorm and an Act of the National Assembly.
