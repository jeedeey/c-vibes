I once had a friend in my secondary school days, whose mother always locked him up in the house and beating him up in the hope of driving out the so called “evil spirit” in him. The report on the street was that, he has serious medical conditions and that he was running mad, which made him to behave irrationally sometimes. I fail him as a friend then, because I lacked proper knowledge about his condition, which made me to usually made jest of him, calling him a mad man and avoiding him when he needed me most. His saving grace came in 2015, when he was recused by an NGO from his mother constant vicious beating on him. To my surprise in 2018, I learnt he is currently in his 200 level in the department of banking and finance at the University of Abuja, and he is reportedly one of the best students in the department. He is now completely normal and doing fine, after receiving adequate medical attention and care, even the mother and the neighborhood were surprised at the transformation.

If there is a lesson, I have learnt through my friend experience, it is that stigmatizing those with mental health challenges should be discouraged. They need our care, attention and love not condemnation. Research has shown that mental health challenges, regardless of the origin, ways, means or causes, is treatable and can easily be managed with proper care and attention from those around the victims. Attaching any devious approach to those with mental health challenges should be criminalize.

People especially the youths tend to listen or even seek their peer’s advice and follow it when confuse about a certain situation than going to the right source or to the appropriate authority. I believe my role would be to offer good advice and direct them to seek information from the relevant authorities and other credible organization. Hence from now on, I see myself as a mental health advocate in my local community, educating them in my own little way, about the causes of mental illness, ways and manners to treat it and possible solution to mental health challenges, when adequate care and love is shown to the victims.

There are clearly many perspectives on what mental illness is, but according to the advanced English dictionary “mental illness is a state of being mentally ill, mental disorders”. Mental illness in simple term is a mental health disorder, which refers to a wide range of mental health conditions-disorder, that affect the mood, thinking, and behavior, examples of mental illness includes, depression, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia etc. However many advocates of mental health rejects the term “mental illness” altogether, as it supports what is considered the “medical model” of mental health. The medical model of mental health is based on the idea that there is a physiological impairment creating a neurochemical imbalance in a person brain, resulting in mental illness. Despite this popular view, it is based on flawed science.

To understand alternatives approaches to mental health, it is first important to understand what mental illness actually is. Most Nigerians today, still harbors outdated or wrong notions about the causes of mental illness. It is first important to understand that mental health challenges can happen to anybody, no matter your age, color or family background. It is equally important to know about the various causes of mental illness and know that it is treatable, just like any other diseases.

When the world health organization (WHO) was established 60 years ago, it guiding principles was based on the “happiness, harmonious relationships and well-being of all people in all areas of life including mental health”. The stress on mental health was clearly repeated in the (WHO) constitution, this shows that it was not an incidental choice of words. No matter their condition, people with mental health challenges are “human beings” first and deserve their own human rights, which include “right from discrimination and stigma”. To help those with mental illness, the Asido foundation popular refrains comes to mind, “there should be no more shame associated with mental illness than there is for physical illness”.

Information is the key to removing stigma and discrimination tag attach to mental illness in Nigeria. A situation where majority of those with health challenges are still been taken to local medicine house, spiritual and traditional houses, which are not expertly trained to handle such cases, clearly shows the need to fill the information gap. Sadly there is extensive documentation of human right abuses in those places. But that where the opportunity comes in “the Nigeria youths”, youths in Nigeria constitutes about 60% of the population, thus a proper orientation campaign aimed at these age-group will help to remove the stigma and prejudices attach to mental illness. It must be noted that the older age group bracket have already made up their minds based on the information available to them, but with proper teaching and effective mental health literacy campaign, it will helps to mold the minds of the young ones and eliminates any prejudices, thereby raising a new change-maker in their/this generation.   
 
The attendant consequences of stigma and discrimination against people with mental health challenges are felt all over the country, as it poses multiple challenges both to the nation, the families and the victims. Hence it should not be left although to the government alone to solved, that is why all stakeholders’ hands must be on deck from the youths, traditional rulers, religious leaders and NGOs all have a role to play in the fight against stigma and discrimination attach to mental illness. This initiative should be based at the local level with well-established social media network that will facilitate effective coordination of all awareness campaign. This initiative should be based in the most affected states and be a continuous exercise, where people can seek information and get treatment for mental health issues.

Mental illness is treatable, but what is the use of information when it does not reach it intended audience or achieve it aims. A well-informed Nigerians youth is the key to achieving the spread of factual information about mental illness in their various communities, thereby eradicating stigma, dogmas and discriminations attach to the victims.
