"It is a psychological condition that occurs when a victim of abuse identifies and attaches, or bonds, positively with their abuser." 

This syndrome was originally observed when hostages who were kidnapped not only bonded with their kidnappers, but also fell in love with them.
Simply put, it is a situation whereby a spouse or lovers have feelings of trust, affection and attachment despite being abused either physically or emotionally.
Physical abuse can involve beating of the abused or his/her property being destroyed by lover.
Physically, he or she is abused by beIng beaten, battered or destroyed. 
While emotional abuse entails bullying, talking down on the spouse/lovers or use of provocating and insulting words on the abused either in the public place or privately.
Psychologically, the abusee's mind, soul, brain, body and heart are attached to that of the abuser. The abuser believes, likes and loves the abusee with passion. And you wonder if they were Sesame twins.

Love is such a beautiful thing that both partners should be at liberty to enjoy. You are not supposed to endure physical and emotional pains and abuse in a relationship! 
Going through emotional and physical pain in the name of love is understably unreasonable and could actually be a psychological issue. To me, it is a big NO and I think victims should not be left alone to handle the situation where possible!
<blockquote>It is not a big deal when lovers quarrel or argue and later on make up. If it is real love, once they make up the love grows stronger. However, in the case of someone going through Stockholm Syndrome, the reverse is the case, he or she is abused physically, mentally and emotionally but he/she never sees anything wrong or absurd in the so called relationship.</blockquote> 
Often times, the victim is being beaten, injured, insulted but he /she still goes back to the "love of his/her life" under the assumption most times that He or She deserves to be maltreated. All in the name of love!!. Grr!!!
I could remember my undergraduate days in the popular Omolayo Hostels in UNAAD in the early 2000. Ola and Lola(not real names) were so much into each other that they were given the best couple on campus and in the hostel. It was a relationship that others were envious of. But what went on beneath the surface were eyesores and irrational, as he beat her.

There was a day Ola beat Lola to the extent blood was coming out from her ear. 
To the best of my  knowledge that wasn't his first time of beating her. (You wonder how i knew? My roommate's boyfriend was a coursemate with Ola. Winks!). 
To my utmost surprise, Ola and Lola were on motion ground the next day for photo shoots. They were both wearing native attires. I was shocked to my bone marrow.

Abuse of one's lover despite the claim that they love and cannot do without each other is rampant in various homes and the society at large. The situation whereby the wife destroys her husband's property when fighting and the husband still claims he loves her is also part of Stockholm Syndrome. Some of these victims would come out to say the ordeal they face. After a couple of weeks or months you will be surprised to see them together AGAIN and you wonder why! And they let you know they can not do without each other, that he/she had come to plead, how he got her gifts and how she gave him good sex and cooked well. "That he loves me that is why he's angry with me". The victims are the real "till the death do us part!" (In a negative and ridiculous ways).
The abusers are so attached to their abusees that their is no way you can convince them to leave the abusive relationship. Some will be of the opinion that once they marry it will stop. Hell no!!! It can never stop and it won't stop.
The abused exhibits loyalty towards the abusee in spite of the danger or risk he or she is exposed to. They so much believe in each other and see the 'best' in each other despite the pains and agonies they go through or bring upon themselves.

In  most cases of Stockholm Syndrome, victims  only listen to you when they aren't with their partners but once they set their eyes on them that is all... Their lovers could be cultists, most especially on campuses, rich guys, big boys, politicians etc.
Some victims come out to say what they go through in order to be healed while some keep to themselves to avoid people rising to their defense or  condemnation of their situation. They have forgotten that people will say more once they die.
- It is a Disease that the society at large raises eyebrow at but seem unable to correct.
- It is a destructive force in our society because it eventually makes the victim's children to be violent in their ways.
- It should also be discouraged right from homes when a child is growing, the boy child should not beat, cheat or abuse his younger or older girl child in the family and vice versa. So that when they grow up they would not abuse or maltreat their partners. No child is superior to the other. We should teach our children how to love, appreciate and compliment one another so that when they grow up they will not depart from it.
- Abusees and abusers need to visit  psychologists for counselling.
- There should be awareness and sensitisation through social media.
- The victims(married ones)can also visit  religious leaders for counselling or for them to be separated on moral grounds.
- Women Affairs Commission and other NGOs that specilaise in home building too can be of great assistance in handling this social menace!
