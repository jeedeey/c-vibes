Death! It is man greatest enemy. Throughout history, it has brought down great men and women, kings and queens, rich and poor, movers and shakers of the society and of course, the beggars and commoners.  It is sad that after all the giant strides and achievement in scientific breakthrough in the last 75 years, man has failed to conquer death. But can man achieve immortality? I leave that to my audience. So if it is certain that we are all going to die; why do people still wail and talk about the subject when their loved one passed away, I guess it depends on the nature and manner of death. People want to know if their loved ones die quickly or slowly, in peace or in agonizing pain and is it natural or are there foul play involved. Well that good to know, cause how we meet our creator is very important in this part of the world. However what do we say about those who lost their lives in accidents and road mishaps.

Even if the unfeeling head of the tortoise is your delicacy, you are not likely to ignore the weekly; if not daily rate and speed at which preventable accidents occur on the Felele/Lokoja/Abuja road axis. Where do we start from! Should we begin to count the numbers of lives lost or the worth of properties destroyed on the road? You answer that. What do we get after the counting of the dead bodies and destroyed properties; empty promises from the government to find lasting solutions yet nothing tangible has been done. History is wise and brainy, and it is a fact that those who fail to learn from history are doom to repeat it. Permit me to digress a little; today being the 23th of January2021 mark the 107 days anniversary of the deadly tanker explosion in Lokoja that claimed more than 25 innocent lives, which includes “primary and university students who are in their prime and full of energy”, it was a sad day for the state and Nigeria as whole. But before you asked me about what measures have been put in place to prevent such incident from repeating itself, you should ask the family members of those who lost their loved ones on January 2021 on the same road due to the same old-time problem that cause the first one.

When the BBC reporter Chris Ewokor was given a report about the unfortunate accident, he said “these types of incidents are common on Nigerian roads”. This statement cannot be farther from the truth, does these lines sound familiar “the crash happened on Wednesday morning on a major highway in Lokoja when the driver lost control of the tanker after the brakes failed, local police said”. When no VIP is in involved, all we get are numbers of the dead not names, ah what a hard time to die in Nigeria; there is even level in dead.

<blockquote>From first week of January frequent accident occur on daily basis, on the 18th of January at exactly 8am in the morning, residents awoke to find a Toyota wagon and an unmarked J5 van involved in accident at Felele junction with passengers of both vehicles sustaining different among of injuries. As if that was not enough, as the first aid respondents and passerby were trying to help the accidents victims; another set of vehicles collision occurs few meters away from the first one at the oworo estate junction, eyewitnesses blame it on over speeding by the driver of the articulated truck who fail to take note of the road diversion ahead due to road repairs.</blockquote>

I could go on and on about the rate in which avoidable accidents happens on that road. Many have lost their loved ones and family’s members on this “road to death” Felele/Lokoja/Abuja axis without any lasting solutions proffer by the state government. However it must be the noted that the causes of these unfortunate incidents can be blame on the following
1.	Reckless and dangerous driving
2.	Traffic congestion
3.	No traffic enforcement agency or personnel along the route to penalize traffic offenders
4.	 Hawking and road side trading along the highway
5.	Indiscriminate parking of vehicles beside the road
6.	Bad road portions
Well these are just few of the numerous problems responsible for the prevalent rate of road accidents on the Lokoja/Abuja axis. While the road users, especially the drivers still need more education on (traffic rules) how to behave when on the road, the buck over rest with the state government to resolve the issues. It is time to declare a state of emergency on the road instead of the “usual empty promises” after each accident. Position of traffic enforcement personnel along the busy junctions. Let the road be upgraded and expanded or create a road bypass, while enforcing the no hawking policy to keep the hawkers away from the highway, (yes will know that they are trying to make ends meet through their business) but it should be within a safe distance; for their own safety and everyone.

However I cannot leave without praying to God to comfort the families of those who have lost their loved ones on this road due to preventable accidents and also to others who have lost someone’s due to the underdevelopment of Nigeria. As the popular saying thus “when there is life, there is hope”. Thus we are hoping the government will use this window of opportunity to find a lasting solution to the problem and changed it from the “road of death” to the “road of life”. Kogians are watching!
