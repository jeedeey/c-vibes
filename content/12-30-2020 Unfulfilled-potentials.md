Nasarawa State is reffered to as the "home of solid minerals" which is true to an extent but the most resource endowed State in Nigeria happens to be the confluenece State which has been nicknamed as the confluence of resourses.

Kogi State is the most endowed in terms of mineral resources as the state is blessed with 28 selected minerals out of 33 that have been geologically identified in Nigeria.
little wonder the richest black-man in the world decided to site one of the biggest cement plants in the world in Kogi State bacause of the abundance of limestone at Obajana. 

All mineral in the State are available in commercial quantities, all Local Government in the State has not less than two mineral resources. 
Mineral resources available: include Granites, Mica, Coal, Clay, Kaolin, Gold,  Gemstones,

The above listed resources would leave any country salivating but reverse is the case as these resources remain unexplored and untapped. 
Kogi state has the potential to become an industrial power-house in Nigeria if it's resources are explored and utilized.
The state has the largest deposit of Iron Ore in Nigeria and among highest in the World, with an estimated total figure of 3-4 billons tones.
Four billon tonnes of Iron Ore in the global market today is worth for trillions us dollars ($4000,000,000,000) or more.
If four(4) trillion us dollars is gradually remitted to the State and Nationl coffers is enough to solve all the country's needs not to mention the other solid minerals available in the State lying fallow.

The available resources in Kogi State has the potenntials to free the country for misery and poverty, but with the availability of the rich mineral the State still depends on federal Government for montly stipends and generating a measly one billion naira from tax revenue despite enormous potentials to generate in multiple fold.
