The Felele-Lokoja early hour rush was brought to a halt on wednesday, 21st october, 2020 as motorists, riders and business activities were restricted as Kogi Sate Polytechnic students barricated the ever busy Felele-Lokoja-Abuja highway.

This was in solidary with an Hnd two Public Administration student who was knocked down by a hit and run driver at 8pmm, 20th october 2020 close to the popular Okadigbo Bar.

The news of the death of the accident victim at the early hour of the day angered the protesting students with the demand to repair the damaged road portion of the highway to put stop to the use of one-way route by motorists and also to see the appropriate authority to make  demands know.

The protest resulted to road block with lots of trucks and cars travelling on queue trying to gain access to the road.

Efforts by the security operatives to disparse the protesting students with tear gas and gun shots proved abortive as the students were resolute to press their demands and make their grivances known.

The peaceful protest and road block however, caused tension as some students run helter-skelter and scrampling to gain access to the school as there Exam was slated for 8:30 am.

Normacy was later restored, around the road blocked and the polytechnic with the intervention, and address giving by the school Public Relation Officer, Mr Omale who showed solidary with the course of the students and promised to contact the appropriate authority to find lasting solution to the killing of students by motorists due to reckless driving and bad road.
