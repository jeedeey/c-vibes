You may have been waiting for this! Now its here! Don't forget to thank me later!

However, Most people are confused on how to monetize their YouTube channel, especially when they haven't reach the requirements of YouTube on 1000 subscribers and the 4000hrs watch time as against the previous requirements of view counts.

<blockquote>This policy was put in place by YouTube to at least keep users longer in their platform, and this is why I advise you make sure you provide quality video content to keep your viewers engaged, with this, you are creating Chances!</blockquote>

However, this can be frustrating for most YouTubers, as most people could let say have views of 20k and like 300 subscribers, Some do give up, but Today I will be sharing with you three ways you can monetise your channel and best alternative to google AdSense and how you can monetize without yet reaching that normal requirements for monetisation.

## Here are three best alternative to Google AdSense
1.Offer services:
  You are a proficient content marketer? Or maybe you can help others take control of their life through consulting sessions? This can be an excellent way on how to make money using YouTube videos to generate leads.
  - Best for: YouTubers that can help people in certain fields by offering consulting services Here is what you need to know about it.
  - It gives you a wide group of possible prospects. Users on YouTube are from all over the world, which means that you have access to people no matter where you or they are. Compared to when you offer your services locally where you are limited to the businesses or people that live in your area.
  - You'll be setting yourself as an expert in the niche. When you use YouTube videos to demonstrate your knowledge, people start perceiving you as an authority in your niche. This means more people will be eager to benefit from your services.
  - Once you grow your channel large enough, people will ask for your services. If you make videos, teaching people how to do certain things, you may find that people will come asking for your services even though you don't advertise them anywhere. That's because they see you know what you're talking about.

### How to make it happen for your self
  - Start by making videos to build trust. Create videos where you teach skills related to your services.
  - Don't stand back from sharing information. You may feel like you don't want to give up too much information because, “If I teach them how to do it, they won't hire me, right?”. Well, not exactly. There will be people who are there to learn for themselves, which is a good thing for you because they will engage and help grow your channel.
  - But there will also be possible prospects, who have the money to hire you and don't have time to invest in learning. Yet, before they get to pay you for services, they have to first know you are good at what you're doing.
  Hope you got it now? Next
  - Get video testimonials. Having others vouch for you will raise your trust levels. Just make sure the testimonials are genuine. Paying someone to record a scripted testimonial is not a great idea as your viewers may notice it's not real. Don't try it all.

2.Merchandizing and products Another way to monetize your YouTube channel is through selling merchandise. There're two ways you can go with this. You can either source products, buy them in bulk, and sell them at a higher price (whether on Amazon or Shopify strategy). Or, if you produce items, you can take advantage of YouTube and sell them on your channel :
This is best for: YouTubers that manufacture their own products (like jewelry making, artists).

### What you need to know about this
  - It's time-consuming. You'll have to handle the orders, packing, and delivery. This process may take a huge amount of time. If you want to jump into selling items to make money on YouTube, make sure you have enough time on hand to deal with it in a professional way. If you don't honor your orders with professionalism, you won't get far with it. Customer satisfaction is one of the most important aspects of e-commerce.
  - It requires space to store the products.You'll be needing a space to use as a warehouse. You can do this in your own home, but depending on the dimensions of the items, your place may start to feel crowded.
  - You need to be aware of the fees. There will be shipping fees from the manufacturer to you, packing supplies, warehouse supplies (*if you chose to store your items in a warehouse). Make sure that all you have to pay for scales up with what you'll be getting for it and you'll still be left with a profit. But please start with what you have and grow, don't try what you can't carry!
  - If you're making your own products, this is perfect. When you're the creator of the items, all you have to worry about are the materials needed and the packing supplies (and the time you have to put into creating the items, of course). And if you already create things, it means that you love doing it. YouTube gives you a chance to do what you love and get paid for it.
### Few tips on How to make it happen
  - Choose the items you want to sell. If you're sourcing products, you can use some tips on how to find the best products to sell on Amazon or Jumia, konga etc. If you're sourcing products, you can use some tips on how to find the best products to sell on Amazon. Lets say are into mini-importation You can source products from China, where the manufacturing fees are lower, and sell them on another market (like US or UK even Nigeria depending on your audience) at a higher price. Pick out products that are light, hard to break, and preferably small.
  -  Build a YouTube channel around those products. In order to sell items, you don't have to solely make videos talking about them. Contrary, you want to make videos that are relevant to your products, but which don't directly sell them. Say you want to sell jewelry. You can make videos about choosing the right earrings for an occasion, maintaining jewelry, or organizing necklaces. These kinds of videos can be optimized for ranking and will bring traffic to your channel. Moreover, you'll set yourself as an authority figure in the niche who people will trust. Finally, My hands is now hurting me! But its the last tip, I must Drop it and rest!

3.YouTube sponsorships I personally have not tried this before but I know for sure its Another way to monetize YouTube without Adsense. his is the how some YouTubers earn money. Getting sponsored by a brand means that you get paid to promote the said brand in your videos. :
However this is best for YouTube channels with a good following. What you should to know about this

### What you need to know about this
  - You need a base of subscribers before you can get YouTube sponsorships. In order for brands to collaborate with you, there needs to be something for them to benefit from. When you don't have any following, or too few subscribers, brands won't be interested in your channel because there are no possible prospects for their products. Just like you won't go where you don't benefit! True or false? And as such, when you create a channel, first of all build an audience, Build an audience, engage them with Quality content!! If you need the best, practice like a pro, behave like a king and don't compromise, just be intentional to give quality content.
  - You can get paid with money or goods. If your YouTube channel is too small, brands will give you free items in exchange for promotion instead of money.
  - Sponsors will come to you in time. When your channel will start growing, you'll be receiving proposal emails for sponsorships. Businesses are looking to promote their products everywhere their targeted audience is spending time. And if your channel is one of those places, you'll get hit by proposals. Why? Its only because you give in the time to create quality video and content! Please be a pro, if you are not, please take out time each week to recreate yourself! Hustle would pay in the long run! How to make this happen for You
  - Find businesses that are relevant to your channel. Take some time to research which brands are selling products that your audience have interest in. Make a list of them, also take into account their popularity. Start small and grow from there.
  - Set some ground rules for your channel Sponsors will try to bend the collaboration in their favor. So you must learn how to negotiate your worth, I suggest you read "The act of the Deal" by Donald Trump! So you don't get dragged into something you are not comfortable with, it's best to set some rules for yourself that you are not willing to compromise. For example, you might not agree to let sponsors suggest editing your videos. If so, be clear on it.
  - Prepare your pitch. In order to convince brands to pay you for promotion, you have to write a compelling proposal which highlights why they should do it. If you have previous experience with promoting products, you should feature in your pitch the positive results you got.
  - Learn to negotiate. Don't accept an offer from the start. Usually, people start up with a smaller amount of money that they are actually willing to pay. Don't pass on the chance to receive more money.
  - Do not accept sponsorships that are not related to your niche You may find that sometimes brand come to you with proposals for sponsorships but they are not at all relevant to your channel. If it's not relevant for your audience, don't do it. It may seem like you give up an opportunity of making money off YouTube, but promoting irrelevant products will drive your subscribers away. No one wants to waste their precious data on videos that doesn't meet a need they want. I hope you got some clarity for YouTube from this post?
